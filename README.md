# LetsMakeAC64Game
Each weekend I will be coding a new 16K C64 game live on stream, but with one important detail. Every part of the games design will be decided by votes on Twitter and Discord.

Everyone is welcome to come and watch and join in, hopefully it will help those looking to get into C64 Assembly and hopefully we can all share and learn with the more experienced folks.

All coding will only be done live on stream with the exception of some setup/helper libraries that I will share via Github. Any major decisions that crop up while live that cannot wait for a vote will be decided by the viewers.
